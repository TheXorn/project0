# project0
Project 0 for CS50W, I learned a bit about bootstrap and different elements like ordered and unordered lists, and tables. Working with a navbar was also something I took away form this project. 

index.html contains my landing page
hobbies.html demonstrates an unordered list and a picture
pets.html contains an ordered list similar to hobbies but with the title on top
projects.html contains a table styled with bootstrap
main.scss and associated files conains all my styling for the pages

NOTE: I used some royalty free images for this website but I do not have the original photographers information, I do not intend to use these images for profit, and I did not take these photos myself all rights belong to those who took the photos.
